# LinkedIn Easy Apply Bot ü§ñüì©

A Python script that uses **Selenium WebDriver** to automate the **LinkedIn Easy Apply** process. The bot logs in securely using environment variables, navigates job listings, detects "Easy Apply" buttons, autofills phone numbers, and submits applications ‚Äî skipping those with extra steps.

---

## Features üìã

* **Secure Login**: Uses `os.environ` to safely fetch LinkedIn email, password, and phone numbers.
* **Easy Apply Detection**: Finds and clicks the **Easy Apply** button if present.
* **Autofill Phone Number**: Inputs a phone number from a list of formats until accepted.
* **Single-Step Application Handling**: Submits applications only if no resume uploads or questionnaires are required.
* **Overlay & Modal Cleanup**: Dismisses popups, dialogs, and safety notices.
* **Randomized Behavior**: Mimics human browsing delays to avoid bot detection.
* **Failsafe Skipping**: Skips invalid or multi-step job applications without crashing.

---

## Libraries Used üîå

* [`selenium`](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)
* `os` (built-in)
* `time` (built-in)
* `random` (built-in)

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

1. Opens LinkedIn's job search URL in Microsoft Edge.

2. Logs in using your email and password via environment variables.

3. Waits for manual CAPTCHA/puzzle solving.

4. Scrolls through all job cards on the page.

5. For each job:

   * Clicks the job card to load details.
   * Checks for an Easy Apply button.
   * Clicks the button if found.
   * Fills in the phone number (tries 2 formats).
   * If no extra steps are required:

     * Submits the application.
     * Closes confirmation modals.

6. Skips jobs with extra steps or invalid fields and continues gracefully.
